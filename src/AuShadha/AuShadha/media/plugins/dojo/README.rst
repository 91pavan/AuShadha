DOJO LIBRARY DIRECTORY
=======================

This directory will house all the files of Dojo. 

Please download the Dojo library from http://dojotoolkit.org/download/

You can choose the Dojo Toolkit release / SDK release. 

SDK release is good for development as you can see errors better. It will be a bigger download. 


Toolkit release is optimised for Deployment and is a smaller download.
